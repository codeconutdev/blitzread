## Description (4000 characters max)

**Read Faster. Retain More. Train Your Brain.**

BlitzRead uses RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technology to help you read 2-3x faster than normal. Whether you're catching up on articles, reading books, or processing emails, BlitzRead makes it effortless.

**HOW IT WORKS**

Traditional reading requires your eyes to move across lines of text, which slows you down. BlitzRead eliminates this by displaying one word at a time in the same spot. Your eyes stay fixed, and your brain processes words faster.

Each word flashes with its Optimal Recognition Point (ORP) highlighted in red—the letter your eye naturally focuses on. This smart timing helps your brain recognize words instantly.

**FEATURES**

**WHO IT'S FOR**

**THE SCIENCE**

RSVP technology has been studied since the 1970s and is proven to increase reading speed while maintaining comprehension. By eliminating eye movement and presenting words at your optimal pace, your brain can process information faster.

The ORP (Optimal Recognition Point) is typically the letter slightly left of center in each word—the spot your eye naturally focuses on. Highlighting it in red gives your brain a visual anchor, making recognition instant.
